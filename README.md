# PracticeExamForDrivingLicense
To get a Lebanese Driving License you need to be able to answer 30 MCQ questions within 15 minutes.
I gathered the possible questions and made a program that allows you to practice for that exam instead of going to the center and practicing there with a similar program. The program is only in english as that's what I will using during the exam.
At the end of the exam you will receive your grade and the questions that you got wrong with there correct answer. 
For the questions about road signs I just used an Indexing format where I search for the sign manually, I didn't want to crop 100 seperate signs and didn't find them on the internet. If someone is willing or wants to use pixel allocation or something for each picture I will also upload a file that you could use, chat gpt did it and it seems legit. 
Have Fun and Good Luck!
